Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java
===========================================
The **Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java** enables you to manage Amazon SQS message payloads with Amazon S3. This is especially useful for storing and retrieving messages with a message payload size greater than the current SQS limit of 256 KB, up to a maximum of 2 GB. Specifically, you can use this library to:

* Specify whether message payloads are always stored in Amazon S3 or only when a message's size exceeds 256 KB.

* Send a message that references a single message object stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

* Get the corresponding message object from an Amazon S3 bucket.

* Delete the corresponding message object from an Amazon S3 bucket.

You can download release builds through the [releases section of this](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib) project.
